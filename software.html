        <h1 id="wrapper-3-2">MY GOAL</h1>
        <p id="wrapper-3-3">I want to be able to solve any future problems
             I encounter with my knowledge of electronics 
             and computer software. My major does not teach
              Computer Science, so I am mostly learning Computer Science
               through my own research and experiments. I have started 
               off focused on battery technology, so far designing custom
                protection circuits for future projects. I am slowly designing robots
                 / automation technology in my spare time, which will function as tools
                  to make my work more efficient.</p>

    <h1 id="wrapper-4-2">TECHNICAL SKILLS</h1>
    <h1 id="wrapper-4-3">C</h1>
    <P id="wrapper-4-4">Low-level design excites me because you become very close to
         the hardware and can exploit significant performance improvements.
          I am very interested in constructing libraries and data structures at a
           low-level, as well as transforming low level constructs from assembly to C. I enjoy the concept of manual
            memory management and use it to my advantage, bringing significant performance improvements 
            in the design of algorithms.</P>

<section id="wrapper-5-1">
    <h1 id="wrapper-5-2">EMBEDDED</h1>
    <p id="wrapper-5-3">In the past year I have used Arduino to connect real life circuitry with my software.
         It has been very rewarding to control physical technology with my code. I am currently 
         taking on many autonomous projects while designing the circuitry and software from the ground up. From an Self-balancing
        robot because I never worked on accelerometer ever this project was mine first complex one. This project took me a while to 
    understanding of higher level of concept on which low-level code and other offset-value works on. </p>

<section id="wrapper-6-1">
    <h1 id="wrapper-6-2">HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, BOOTSTRAP</h1>
    <p id="wrapper-6-3">I decided to build this website from scratch (just a text editor), so that I can gain a better
         understanding of the technology. I will soon be implementing some of my programs on the web, to make
          it easily accessible to a wider audience.</p>
