                <h1 id="wrapper-2-1">IDEA</h1>
                <p id="wrapper-2-2">The main purpose was to design and construct a robot which will 
                    balance on two wheels and charge itself with help of solar panel. The robot should 
                    be able to work on its own without any supervisor. After the supply is provided the robot
                    should start balancing itself. It should also be small so it doesn’t require much space,
                     is easy to carry and is flexible to display at the small space available at an exhibition. 
                     It should be easy to see the components to arouse interest for spectators. </p>

                   <h1 id="wrapper-3-2">WHY ??</h1>
                   <p id="wrapper-3-3">Because of the European Union’s regulations
                        and demands for reduction of CO2 emissions and cities, like Stockholm and Gothenburg,
                         wish to reduce city traffic and CO2 emissions the transportation sector puts more money
                          than ever into developing environmentally friendly vehicles. This includes to look for
                           different solutions to transportation, such as the Segway. To reach the demands the companies
                            needs knowledge in the field of hybrid vehicles technology or fully electric vehicles. 
                            And that puts a demand on new engineers today to have a wide set of knowledge in both 
                            mechanics, power electronics, vehicle dynamics, software, microcomputers,
                             automatic control and different communication techniques among other.
                              This is backed up by, for instance, a project carried out at 
                              Volvo Cars during 2012 to investigate the possibility of 
                              the use of two wheeled load carrying trucks in cities. 
                              AF Technology is a consulting company that strives
                               to be in front of competitors when it comes to
                                knowledge and new technology. They are also
                                 a company that is a regular visitor at
                                  different technical exhibitions 
                                  and Universities in order to
                                   promote and recruit.
                                    For this purpose
                                     they would lik
                                     e to have 
                                     something
                                      eye-catching

                <p id="wrapper-3-3">In the end I achieved my goal and developed a robot which is
                     balancing itself and the concept and ideas I learnt in the beginning were
                      very useful to complete this robot. 
                        The time which I had in the starting of
                         the coding helped a lot and I also came to
                          know the basics of coding and codes required 
                          for the robot.
                        Basically my idea was to develop a 
                        Self-Balancing Robot and I achieved that.
                        Many are components are used in this
                         project work because of which I learnt the basics 
                         of the components.
                        As we know that nowadays technology 
                        is growing daily and the concept 
                        behind this project will be very 
                        useful in coming future. In future
                         this technology will help us in every
                          part of our life like from riding vehicles to spreading our wings for the space.
